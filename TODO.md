# TODO
## tests

write scripts for automised testing

  * check files for readability
  * automatically check generation script for errors
  * compare contents of different files
  * run valgrind (fine in small file test for Zpf1)

## algorithms

  * update lz4
  * import lzham (https://github.com/richgel999/lzham_codec)
    (MIT license)
  * import miniz (https://code.google.com/p/miniz/)
  

## benchmarks

  * compare file sizes (done)
  * measure writing speed (running)
  * measure reading speed (to be finished)
  * measure writing RAM (postponed)
  * measure reading RAM (postponed)

## large scale

  * figure out how to inject the code into gaudi

## license

  * license missing

## fix
